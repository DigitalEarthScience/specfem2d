This example contains a simple example of the use of SPECFEM2D for underwater acoustics simulations.
It computes a signal that propagates in an idealized waveguide with pressure-release surface and bottom. Setting a rigid bottom will be more realistic but needs to modify the code.
The water depth is 25 m, the total range is 7 km, the source is 4 m below the surface and the receiver is 13 m below the surface. The signals are recorded each km from 1 km to 6 km.
The source is a Ricker (i.e. second derivative of a Gaussian) with a dominant frequency of 90 Hz.

This example is defined by three files : Par_file -> contains all the parameters of the run + receivers positions
                                         interfaces -> contains the geometry
                                         SOURCE -> contains the informations about the source

To run the example, type ./run_this_example.sh in this directory. Then see the results in OUTPUT_FILES/. 

In the main directory you will also find:

	- three figures with signals and their spectrograms at 1 km, 3 km, and 6 km. The spectrograms are computed with short-term Fourier transform. The white curves plotted on the spectrograms are the theoretical arrival times of the different modes
	- a figure that displays the vertical variations of the first 6 modes with the  positions of the source and the receiver.
	- a figure that displays the source spectrum and the cutoff frequencies of the first 7 modes.
